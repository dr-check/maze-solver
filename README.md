# maze-solver
A simple maze solver using python3 and tkinter.

The maze is randomly generated in a way that connects two preset entrance and exit cells, and a line will attempt every path until it can connect both cells.
If the maze generates in such a way that it is unsolvable, it will return the message "This maze cannot be solved!", otherwise it will return a success message.
