# Maze Solver
A simple maze solver using python3 and tkinter.  

The maze is randomly generated in a way that connects two pre-set entrance and exit cells, and a line will attempt every path until it can connect both cells.  
  
If the maze generates in such a way that it is unsolvable, it will return the message "This maze cannot be solved!", otherwise it will return a success message.  

## Requirements
* Python3
* tkinter

## How To Run
Once you have downloaded the project, launch it from your terminal. It will open a window to generate the maze and show the solution. Hit X to close the window.
